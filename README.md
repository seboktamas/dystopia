# Dystopia
Thought experiment about the ideal political/social/economic system(s)

## Overview
Inspired by *Imre Mad√°ch*: **The Tragedy of Man**, in the first phase we will lay down the rules and axioms of a *fictional?* political/social/economic system, in a way that it should be for the benefit of all mankind (create an Utopia). In the second phase, we will try to create an Dystopia from it: create stories, situation, how can those rules and axioms backfire, what can go wrong. The third phase is the new version's first phase: based on the experience what should be changed, what new rules can be implemented/what new axioms should we use to create an Utopia.

## Version 0
For initial version we can use one of our current system, which most people consider a good one (or best among the possible options).

## Mechanism
- *Phase 1*: Create an issue about our Utopia's rules and axioms, agree on the best one and *RELEASE* our system.
- *Phase 2*: Create issues, how this can be dystopic. (Issues can contain stories and arguments). Discuss what went wrong and what can be done about it in the stories
- *Phase 3*: Collect all *EXPERIENCE*, what was the problem, what shoud we change to really create an Utopia. Start over with Phase 1.

## Technical
- We should store the rules and axioms in a readme file called *SYSTEM.md*.
- All systems rules/axioms shoud be kept (*versions*).
- All dystopic conversations and arguments should be kept for each versions.
- All *experience* should be collected into a readme file called *EXPERIENCE.md* for all versions.
